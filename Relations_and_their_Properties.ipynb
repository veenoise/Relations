        "#####**Relation** - Representation of the relationship between the elements of the set.\n",
        "#####**Binary Relation** - Binary relation is a set of ordered pairs. We use the notation a R b to denote (a,b) € R, and a Ṟ b to denote (a,b) ∉ R. We say that a is related to b by R.\n",
        "#####**Reflexive** - A relation R on a set A is called reflexive if (a,a) € R for every element a € A. \n",
        "#####**Irreflexive** - The element is not related to itself. ∀a[(a,a) ∉ R] \n",
        "#####**Symmetric** - If a is related to b, then b is also related to a. ∀a ∀b [(a,b) € R -> (b,a) € R]\n",
        "#####**Assymetric** - ∀a ∀b [(a,b) € R -> (b,a) ∉ R]\n",
        "#####**Antisymmetric** - ∀a ∀b [((a,b) € R & (b,a) € R) -> (a=b)]\n",
        "#####**Transitive** - A relation R on a set A is called transitive if whenever (a,b)∈R and (b,c)∈R, then (a,c) ∈ R, for all a,b,c ∈ A.\n",
        "---\n",
        "###**2. Partial Order and Total Order.**\n",
        "#####**Partial Order** - A partial order is a binary relation that captures a notion of order or precedence among elements of a set.\n",
        "#####**Partially Ordered Set** - An ordered set containing the Reflexive, Antisymmetric, and Transitive properties.\n",
        "#####**Hasse Diagram** - It is a graphical orientation of a finite partially ordered set.\n",
        "#####**Maximal Element** - An element for which no other element is larger.\n",
        "#####**Greatest Element** - It must be larger and comparable to every other element of A.\n",
        "#####**Minimal Element** - an element for which no other element is smaller. \n",
        "#####**Least Element** - It must be smaller and comparable to every other element of A.\n",
        "#####**Total Order** - It is known as Linear order, wherein all the elements of a partial order relation are Comparable.\n",
        "---\n",
        "###**3. Combining Relations**\n",
        "#####**Union** - The union operation refers to merging two relations together to create a relation that contains all the items from both original relations. \n",
        "#####**Intersection** - An operation that combines the elements common to both sets, resulting in a new set.\n",
        "#####**Subtraction** - An operation that removes the elements from one set (or relation) that also appear in another set (or relation).\n",
        "#####**Exclusive Or (XOR)** - Typically operates on boolean values, evaluating to true if and only if exactly one of the operands is true.\n",
        "#####**Composition of Relation** - The relation consisting of ordered pairs (a, c), where a ∈ A, c ∈ C, and for which there exists an element b ∈ B such that (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ S. \n",
